Time travel
===========

I am able to time-travel.
However, only to the future and only at a certain pace.
That's why I have to carefully prepare my road-map of places and events to visit on my path.

I'm not a full-time writer (I'm actually not a writer at all) and my goal is not quantity, but rather quality.
So there might be just a few episodes released per year.
This also depends on how many other side projects I currently have and how much I enjoy them.

If you enjoy reading and don't want to wait for me to publish another episode, here are some recommendations:
